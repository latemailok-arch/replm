## 📖 What is replm?

replm is a tool designed to help you work with very long pieces of text, called prompts, quickly and smoothly. It uses a method called recursive language models to break down big tasks into smaller ones. This way, it can handle things that normal tools might struggle with.

This software is based on cutting-edge research by Zhang, Kraska & Khattab from 2025. It lets you offload parts of your text into a system that works like a mini computer, helping the main program think better using smaller steps. Put simply, replm helps make big language tasks easy to manage.
